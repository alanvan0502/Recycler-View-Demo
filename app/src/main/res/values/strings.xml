            This sandwich is stunningly delicious and tastes as good as it is healthy. Any greens of choice will work. The lemon adds an almost sweet taste. Be generous with it!

            Everyone loves this, so double or even triple the recipe! It vanishes in a flash, and also works well as a salsa. It really is our all-time favorite summer salad.

            This soup is so good Essy and I ate it ALL the first time I made it. If someone is hesitant about plant-based food, this has to be a convincer.

            This is FABULOUS alone, topped with fruit of any kind or as a frosting on cake. It is fast to make at the last minute. Use more or less lime according to taste.

            Flavorful recipe for this farm raised fish that is easy and done in minutes! The fish is broiled with a creamy cheese coating for an impressive flavor.
